A Simplistic system, that allows Players to have multiple Characters, which can be customised for all player with `Config.Slots` or personally set a players character count using `setslots`, `remslots`, `enablechar` and `disablechar` Commands :)

## Notes

- Characters are stored in the users table as `char#:license`
- Character deletion does not require manual entries for the tables to remove

## Kashacters

- This project is forked from the [Kashacters resource](https://github.com/FiveEYZ/esx_kashacter)
- Most of the code has been entirely rewritten
- KASH has given permission for this resource to use his code and the addition of a license
- The license obviously does not apply to previous versions and KASH has stated his resource is free to be used however
